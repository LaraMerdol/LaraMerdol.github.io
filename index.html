          <h1>PROJECT PROPOSAL</h1>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>This report is the proposal for our online code editor system project. The main purpose of this report is to present a detailed description of the system, likewise investigate functional and non-functional requirements, and limitations of the system. Furthermore, the report contains a discussion about why/how a database is going to be used as a part of the system.</p>
          
          <h2>Project Description</h2>
          <p>Project_name will be created to facilitate programming practice and contests. Project_name will allow users to improve their programming skills by practicing programming. It will also have problem discussions and user-sponsored programming contests. Companies will be able to initiate challenges in an attempt to lure the skilled programmers. The application won’t limit itself to programming challenges only, System Design challenges will also take place.</p>
          
          <p>Our project will focus on the ability of the programmers and companies to submit and receive solution entries. The motive is to provide storage for challenge questions and entries. The contests will be of two types open contests or closed contests. Any individual will be able to participate in open contests. However, only invited participants will be able to take part in closed challenges. In addition to this, the contest organizers will be able to decide if the participants should be able to see the entries of other participants after the completion of a contest.</p>
          <p>Project_name will have an inbuilt text editor to ease the users’ ability to enter their solutions. We will also store the details regarding user inactivity during the programming challenge. The users will be able to enter a picture for the System Design challenges.</p>
          
          <h2>Discussion</h2>
          <h3>Why do we need to use a database?</h3>
          <p>There are many reasons why our system requires a database. First of all, we need to store information about each registered user, company, and editor. Considering data may include personal information we should be careful about safety issues, using a database is more secure than storing that information in a spreadsheet. Furthermore, considering our functional requirements we should store and manage a large amount of data including coding contest questions, results, answer of users, discussion contexts, and so on accurately, without using a database this would not be possible.  Besides, a well-designed database can provide consistency, atomicity, and isolation considering there will be concurrent processes on data on a daily basis such as searching, sorting, and modifying therefore ensuring integrity in the database holds a great deal of importance.</p>  
          <h3>How do we use the database?</h3>     
           <p>The database will be mainly used according to the users, companies, and editors' activities with the help of queries. Most of the processes will require concurrent access to the database and some of those require an update, delete, and creation of new entities.   For instance, when a company creates a new coding contest a new entity is added to the coding contest table or if the user wants to change her username the specific user entity will be updated. On the other hand, we will use a database for establishing relations between our entities. For instance, every time a user solves one of the coding challenges a new relation entity will be created between the user and a specific coding challenge, and that relation includes the score and other data that the related company or the user itself can retrieve later.</p>           
          <h2>Requirements</h2>
          <h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Start Contest:</strong> Users, Editors, and Companies will be able to start a challenge. They will have to select the type of challenge and the visibility of the challenge.</li>
            <li><strong>Terminate Contest:</strong> The contest organizers will be able to terminate a contest using this functionality.</li>
              <li><strong>Add Solution:</strong> The permitted participants will be able to enter their solution to a question.</li>
               <li><strong>See Status:</strong> The participants will be able to see the status of the entry.</li>
                <li><strong>Start problem discussion:</strong> The functionality will be only available for open contests. The users will be able to start a discussion regarding any area of a given contest problem. </li>
                 <li><strong>Add Practice Problem:</strong> A user can enter a problem for other users to practice their problem-solving skills.</li>
                  <li><strong>Invite Friends:</strong> Any User will be able to invite their friends to join the website social media like Facebook, WhatsApp, Gmail, et cetera.</li>
                   <li><strong>Add Contest Feedback:</strong> Contest participants will be able to rate the contest taking place. The aggregate rating will be stored and displayed before any participant takes part in the contest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rate Organization/Company:</strong> Organizations and Companies available on the website can be rated by the Users. </li>
                    <li><strong>View Interview Questions:</strong> Users who want to practice their problem-solving skills will be able to find previous year's interview questions that will be uploaded by other users.</li>
                    <li><strong>View User Profile:</strong> The Users will be able to see another user’s profile. The information like the user’s social media account, contest history, name, location, etc. will be displayed. </li>
                    <li><strong>View Job Listings:</strong> Users will be able to search for jobs based on certain keywords like summer interns, backend programmer, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Search  Problem Category:</strong> Users will be able to search for problem categories such as “Python Coding Questions”.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create Problem Category:</strong> Editors and Companies can create new problem categories.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Non-functional Requirements</h3>     
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> The system will be mainly used for online coding contests therefore the system should minimize the waiting process for users to retrieve the question and send their answers.  The response time of the system should be low as can be.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Companies, users, and editors use the system concurrently and that means concurrent access to the database and some of those require an update, delete, and creation of new entities. The system should be scalable enough to meet the performance requirements under that workload.</li>
            <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> We should store a large amount of data considering our functional requirements including coding contest questions, results, answers of users, discussion contexts, and so on.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Considering companies may use this system for interview purposes it is crucial that the system will be reliable considering critical failures can affect users' careers in an unwanted way.</li>
            <li><strong>Security: </strong>The system will store information about each registered user, company, and editor. Considering that data may include personal information we should be careful about safety issues, therefore security is an important non-functional requirement for our system.</li>
          </ul>
